# Ultrasonic Sensor Project

#### Project Overview
The Ultrasonic Sensor project demonstrates how to use an ultrasonic sensor with an Arduino Mega to measure distances based on the time it takes for sound waves to bounce back from an object. Ultrasonic sensors are widely used for proximity detection and distance measurement in various applications.

#### Components Needed
- **Arduino Mega**
- **Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04 or similar)**
- **Jumper Wires**

#### Block Diagram

#### Circuit Setup
1. **Connecting the Ultrasonic Sensor to Arduino Mega:**
   - **Trigger Pin (trigPin):** Connected to digital pin 2 on the Arduino Mega.
   - **Echo Pin (echoPin):** Connected to digital pin 3 on the Arduino Mega.
   - **+5V Pin:** Connected to the VCC pin of the ultrasonic sensor.
   - **GND Pin:** Connected to the GND pin of the ultrasonic sensor.

#### Instructions
1. **Code Upload:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE and create a new sketch.
   - Copy and paste the provided Arduino code into the sketch.
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Mega.

2. **Testing:**
   - Open the Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE (set to 9600 baud).
   - Observe distance measurements displayed in centimeters (cm) as detected by the ultrasonic sensor.
   - Place objects at different distances to verify accurate distance readings.

#### Applications
- **Obstacle Avoidance:** Implement in robots or vehicles for detecting obstacles.
- **Liquid Level Detection:** Measure distances to determine liquid levels in tanks.
- **Proximity Sensing:** Detect presence or absence of objects within a specific range.

#### Notes
- **Distance Calculation:** Distance is calculated based on the time it takes for sound waves to travel to the object and back.
- **Speed of Sound:** Assumes a standard speed of sound (343 m/s) in air.
- **Serial Output:** Utilize serial communication for real-time monitoring and logging of distance measurements.
